## Dependencies
This script requires `pyautogui` to work! Install it with `pip3 install pyautogui`

## Usage
1. Run the original minesweeper executable from [The internet archive](https://archive.org/details/winmine), and make sure the entire window is visible.
2. Run the script. It will keep running until a new best time is acheived (Where it will crash with an ugly error message.) The script works with all minesweeper sizes and types.

###### Have fun cheating in minesweeper!
